    - what is Vector Database?
    - How Vector databases work?
    - Use-case's of Vector Databases
      - Recommendation Systems, NLP,Image and Video recognition, LLMs, Anomaly Detection
- how we use in our organization
  - LLM's not trained on organization data (security,cost issues)
  - use RAG, ( still issue if you have a large documents)
  - Generate Embeddings and store in Vector Database.
